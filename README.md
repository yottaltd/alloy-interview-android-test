Follow the [Project setup](#project-setup) steps below to first make sure you can run the project. This is only a skeleton project at the moment but has a couple assets inside; a JSON file containing Coffee shops, and some icons. Once that’s done carry on to the Project brief. 

## Project brief

We’d like to give you a chance to show off your skills by putting together a simple Android app. Don’t worry, we’re not looking for the perfect, or even complete application. This is just an opportunity to show us your programming style, that you’re hot on best practices, and that you know your way around Android and Kotlin. We’d like you to:

1.	Display a scrollable list of coffee shops from the JSON we’ve provided
2.	Add a search bar to find a specific coffee shop in your list
3.	Add a test case

#### Extras (If you have time)

4.	Clicking on the list item should show a modal with the coffee shop details, including, name, address, location, rating, distance from you.
5.	Allow the user to sort by ranking or name.

Once you’re done, share your forked repository with us and we can talk it through.


## Project setup
Fork the repository into your own account and run in Android Studio
